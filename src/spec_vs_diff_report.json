  "summary": "REQ-1 is partially implemented via a new Node validation script for the slug rules, but there is no clear evidence it is wired into a repository-level build/deploy workflow to automatically fail when invalid. REQ-2 README changes are suggested by the file summary, but the provided README diff content is truncated before any troubleshooting section, so the acceptance criteria cannot be fully verified from the shown snippet.",

      "requirement": "Add a repository-level validation step that checks the deployment slug in `frontend/deploy/custom-domain.json` meets the documented domain rules and fails the build/deploy workflow with a clear English error message when invalid.",
      "reason": "A validator script was added, but the diff summary does not show it being invoked by any build/deploy workflow (e.g., package scripts, CI, predeploy hook). Without integration, the build/deploy may not fail automatically when the slug is invalid.",

      "reason": "The diff snippet for `frontend/README.md` is truncated before any troubleshooting section content appears, so the required troubleshooting text and example mapping cannot be confirmed from the provided excerpt alone.",
